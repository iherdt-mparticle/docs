[Blueshift](https://blueshift.com/?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=mparticle) enables large-scale consumer marketers to automate hyper-personalized 'Segment of One' marketing, combining dynamic segmentation with highly personalized content, across multiple marketing channels.

## Prerequisites
 
1.  Obtain your Blueshift API Key [from the Blueshift dashboard](https://app.getblueshift.com/dashboard#/account_setup) or by contacting success@getblueshift.com.  
2. Use the API key to configure a Blueshift output for your mParticle workspace

## Blueshift Configurations

mParticle supports both a server-to-server integration and a client-side kit integration. In-app events and events associated with push notifications will be sent client-side to Blueshift via Blueshift's SDK in conjunction with this kit. All other events will be sent via the server-to-server integration.  

## Blueshift Kit Configuration

You can find Blueshift's Kit implementations and details on how to configure them below.

* [iOS](https://github.com/blueshift-labs/mparticle-apple-integration-blueshift)
* [Android](https://github.com/blueshift-labs/mparticle-android-integration-blueshift)

Add the Blueshift Kit to your iOS or Android app and the mParticle SDK will automatically route appropriate event data to Blueshift client-side.
