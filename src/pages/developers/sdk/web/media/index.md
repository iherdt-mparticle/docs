Collecting media data is critical for tracking user behavior when your customers consume video or audio content through [Android](../../android/media) and [iOS](../../ios/media) mobile applications or on the web. mParticle provides a toolset for integrating media analytics into your customer experience.

The mParticle Media SDK provides a dedicated API for tracking common media events including session start, play, pause, milestones, and end, as well as logging recurring advertising impressions and chapters for segmented content. 

The mParticle Media SDK works hand in hand with the mParticle platform. Data logged from the Media SDK is forwarded to the Web SDK and then forwarded to any included integrations.

The mParticle Media SDK is compatible with [Adobe Analytics for Media](https://docs.adobe.com/content/help/en/media-analytics/using/media-overview.html), supporting the full range of media-related events including heartbeat events. This simplifies an otherwise complicated and error-prone process of setting up media session event tracking and Adobe Heartbeat yourself. 

## Getting Started

Before you can begin using the Media SDK, you need to have a working instance of the mParticle core SDK. At present, we offer support for our Media SDK in a `self-hosting` environment. For more information on this, please refer to the [self-hosting](/developers/sdk/web/self-hosting/) documentation.

1. Install relevant npm packages for your project. The below example uses our [Adobe Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mparticle/web-adobe-client-kit) web integration. When adding Adobe as an output for Javascript in the mParticle web app, there is a setting for Media Tracking Server. When you fill this out, mParticle will load the Heartbeat SDK and send media events to it.

```javascript
// command line
npm i @mparticle/web-sdk @mparticle/web-media-sdk @mparticle/web-adobe-client-kit
```

2. In your main js file, import these modules, and add an mParticle configuration:

```javascript
// Import each library
import mParticle from '@mparticle/web-sdk';
import MediaSession from '@mparticle/web-media-sdk';
import Adobe from '@mparticle/web-adobe-client-kit';

// Configure mParticle as needed for your project
const mParticleConfig = {
  // configuration items
};

// Register each kit to the configuration
Adobe.register(mParticleConfig);

// Initialize mParticle
mParticle.init('your-api-key', mParticleConfig);
```

## Creating an instance of a Media Session

The Web Media SDK provides a `MediaSession` object. Each `MediaSession` object represents a single end to end media experience and relates one-to-one to a piece of content. For example, if a customer is watching a video, pausing, seeking and scrubbing, that is considered a single **session**. If they stop the video, and play another piece of content, that is a new **session**.

```javascript
const mediaSession = new MediaSession(
    mParticle,                    // mParticle SDK Instance
    '1234567',                    // Custom media ID
    'Funny Internet cat video',   // Custom media Title
    120000,                       // Duration in milliseconds
    'Video',                      // Content Type (Video or Audio)
    'OnDemand'                    // Stream Type (OnDemand or LiveStream)
);

// optionally set percentage at which you consider content completed
mediaSession.mediaContentCompleteLimit = 90;
```

## Summary Events

Summary events are automated events that contain an accumulated record of what occured during a session, individual segments, and individual ads.

### Session Summary Events

A Session Summary event tracks from when a `MediaSession` is initialized to when it's de-initialized or when `logMediaSessionEnd` is called. The more accurate and detailed developers are with `logPlay`, `logPause`, `logAdStart`, and other media events, the more accurate the summary data will be.

The following table explains the different parts of the Session Summary event.

| Session Summary Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
|  "media_session_id" | A unique identifier automatically created for each session |
| "content_id" | A unique identifier that can set by the user when initializing a session |
| "content_title" | The title of the content. Can be set by the user when initializing a session |
| "media_session_start_time" | Timestamp created on `logMediaSessionStart` event |
| "media_session_end_time" | Timestamp of most recent valid event |
| "media_time_spent" | Total seconds user spent on this session |
| "media_content_time_spent" | The total seconds user spent playing content |
| "media_content_complete" | True if `logMediaContentEnd` was called or if user progressed past percentage set in `MediaSession.mediaContentCompleteLimit` |
| "media_session_segment_total" | The number of segments progressed into by the user |
| "media_total_ad_time_spent" | The total seconds that ads played during this session |
| "media_ad_time_spent_rate" | The parcentage of playback time that was ad content |
| "media_session_ad_total" | The number of ads played in the media session |
| "media_session_ad_objects" | An array of unique identifiers for ads played during this media session |

### Segment Summary Events

A Segment Summary event tracks from when `logSegmentStart` is called to when either `logSegmentSkip` or `logSegmentEnd` is called. Segments could be the chapters of an audiobook or scenes in a movie.

The following table explains the different parts of the Segment Summary event.

| Segment Summary Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "media_session_id" | A unique identifier automatically created for each session |
| "content_id" | A unique identifier that can set by the user when initializing a session |
| "segment_title" | The title of the segment |
| "segment_index" | The index of the segment |
| "segment_start_time" | Timestamp created on `logSegmentStart` event |
| "segment_end_time" | Timestamp of most recent valid event in segment |
| "media_segment_time_spent" | Total seconds user spent on this segment |
| "segment_completed" | True if `logSegmentEnd` was called to end the segment |
| "segment_skipped" | True if `logSegmentSkip` was called to end the segment |

### Ad Summary Events

An Ad Summary event tracks from when `logAdStart` is called to when either `logAdSkip` or `logAdEnd` is called.

The following table explains the different parts of the Ad Summary event.

| Ad Summary Keys | Description |
| --- | --- |
| "media_session_id" | A unique identifier automatically created for each session |
| "ad_break_id" | A unique identifier that can set by the user when initializing an ad break |
| "ad_content_id" | A unique identifier that can set by the user when initializing an ad |
| "ad_content_title" | The title of the ad |
| "ad_content_start_time" | Timestamp created on `logAdStart` event |
| "ad_content_end_time" | Timestamp of most recent valid event in segment |
| "ad_completed" | True if `logAdEnd` was called to end the segment. |
| "ad_skipped" | True if `logAdSkip` was called to end the segment. |

## Logging Media Events

Once your session is instantiated, you will need to trigger a `SessionStart`. This should be done _at the moment the user interacts with your content_. For example, if the media is set to trigger on a user click, and your player fires a `play` event when the content starts, the session must begin before the `play` event.

1. Start a session

```javascript
const options = {
    customAttributes: {
    },
    currentPlayheadPosition: 0,
};
mediaSession.logMediaSessionStart(options);
```

2. Log a play event

```javascript
const options = {
    customAttributes: {
        content_rating: 'epic',
        additional: {
            attribute: 'foo',
        },
    },
    currentPlayheadPosition: 0,
};
mediaSession.logPlay(options);
```

3. (optional) Fire other events for user interaction, i.e. `pause`

```javascript
const options = {
    customAttributes: {
        content_rating: 'epic',
        additional: {
            attribute: 'foo',
        },
    },
    currentPlayheadPosition: 32,
};
mediaSession.logPause(options);
```

4. End the Media Content once the content is complete

```javascript
const options = {
    customAttributes: {
        content_rating: 'epic',
        additional: {
            attribute: 'foo',
        },
    },
    currentPlayheadPosition: 30000,
};
mediaSession.logMediaEnd(options);
```

5. End the Media Session once the user interaction is over (such as after a post-roll or if the app is terminated)

```javascript
const options = {
    customAttributes: {
        content_rating: 'epic',
        additional: {
            attribute: 'foo',
        },
    },
    currentPlayheadPosition: 30000,
};
mediaSession.logMediaSessionEnd(options);
```

## Logging Advertising

In most cases, advertising comes in as a series of `Ad Breaks` each containing numerous `Ads`. The Media SDK provides both sets of functionality so that you can track this behavior.

1. Fire an `AdBreakStart` event

```javascript
mediaSession.logAdBreakStart({
  id: '123456',
  title: 'pre-roll',
  duration: 6000
});
```

2. Trigger an `AdStart` event

```javascript
mediaSession.logAdStart({
  id: '4423210',
  advertiser: "Mom's Friendly Robot Company",
  title: 'What?! Nobody rips off my kids but me!',
  campaign: 'MomCorp Galactic Domination Plot 3201',
  duration: 60000,
  creative: 'A Fishful of Dollars',
  siteid: 'moms',
  placement: 'first',
  position: 0
});
```

3. Fire `AdEnd` or `AdSkip` when appropriate

```javascript
mediaSession.logAdEnd();
```

4. Trigger an `AdBreakEnd` event when all ads have completed

```javascript
mediaSession.logAdBreakEnd();
```

## Generating Custom Events

The Media SDK will generate a `MediaEvent` for client-side kits such as Adobe Media Analytics, however the event can be converted to look just like a typical mParticle custom event that may be used to create audiences, used in calculated attributes, and sent to most mParticle integrations for analysis and activation.

To enable Custom event generation, pass a boolean to the initialization of your `MediaSession` to enable the Log Page Event (aka Custom Event) feature:

```javascript
// Later in your code, when a user begins to engage with your content
const mediaSession = new MediaSession(
    mParticle,                    // mParticle SDK Instance
    '1234567',                    // Custom Media ID
    'Funny Internet cat video',   // Custom Media Title
    120000,                       // Duration in milliseconds
    'Video',                      // Content Type (Video or Audio)
    'OnDemand'                    // Stream Type (OnDemand or LiveStream)
    true                          // Log Page Event Toggle (true/false)
)
```

### Custom Event Schema

The Media SDK will generate Custom events per the specification below.

#### Event Names

The Media SDK exposes methods that will trigger Media Events based on the most common player functions. The Media SDK maps every `MediaSession` API to a predefined Custom event name. The table below details all of the predefineed Media Events:

| Media Session API | Custom Event Name |
| --- | --- |
| mediaSession.logPlay() | 'Play' |
| mediaSession.logPause() | 'Pause' |
| mediaSession.logMediaContentEnd:() | 'Media Content End' |
| mediaSession.logMediaSessionStart() | 'Media Session Start' |
| mediaSession.logMediaSessionEnd() | 'Media Session End' |
| mediaSession.logSeekStart() | 'Seek Start' |
| mediaSession.logSeekEnd() | 'Seek End' |
| mediaSession.logBufferStart() | 'Buffer Start' |
| mediaSession.logBufferEnd() | 'Buffer End' |
| mediaSession.logPlayheadPosition() | 'Update Playhead Position' |
| mediaSession.logAdClick() | 'Ad Click' |
| mediaSession.logAdBreakStart() | 'Ad Break Start' |
| mediaSession.logAdBreakEnd() | 'Ad Break End' |
| mediaSession.logAdStart() | 'Ad Start' |
| mediaSession.logAdEnd() | 'Ad End' |
| mediaSession.logAdSkip() | 'Ad Skip' |
| mediaSession.logSegmentStart() | 'Segment Start' |
| mediaSession.logSegmentEnd() | 'Segment End' |
| mediaSession.logSegmentSkip() | 'Segment Skip' |
| mediaSession.logUpdateQoS() | 'Update QoS' |

#### Event Attributes

All of our events support an options parameter that can contain custom attributes to allow a customer to capture valuable information with every media event. Each attribute will be logged to best describe the session characteristics for that event at that time.

The customer can choose from our list of predefined attributes below, which are mapped to custom third-party attributes, such as Adobe Standard Metadata, when forwarded to their respective vendor. A customer is also free to add their custom attributes of their own, which will pass through as-is when forwarded to a partner service.

Note: Depending on your player, you will need to either enable the callback method to receive updates for playhead position and quality of service (QoS) or set up a job to frequently poll for the current values.

```javascript
mediaSDK.logMediaSessionStart({
    customAttributes: {
        content_title: 'The Best of Both Worlds',
        content_season: 3,
        content_episode: 26,
        my_custom_attribute: 'Locutus'
    }
});
```

#### Vendor specific attributes

In some cases a third-party vendors, such as Adobe, may require custom attributes to be submitted a differnt format as our own, such as `content_show` vs `s:meta:a.media.show`, which would require duplicate information to be passed. In these cases, we provide vendor-specific mappings for some of our custom attributes, which should reduce this duplication.

For example:

| mParticle Custom Attribute | Adobe Heartbeat Metadata      |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| content_show               | s:meta:a.media.show           |

| content_asset_id           | s:meta:a.media.asset          |
| content_genre              | s:meta:a.media.genre          |
| content_first_air_date     | s:meta:a.media.airDate        |

        }
    }
}
```

## Using the Event Listener

In cases where you may need to handle some custom functionality when a media event occurs, the Media SDK provides a `mediaEventListener` which will provide a callback.

For example, if you need to trigger a custom function when Play or Pause occurs:

```
const myCallback = function(mediaEvent) {
    // Some custom callback method defined by user
    // Should only trigger when play or pause is fired
    if (
        mediaEvent.type == MediaEventType.Play ||
        mediaEvent.type == MediaEventType.Pause
    ) {
        // Get the Media Event as an mParticle Page Event
        const mpEvent = mediaEvent.toPageEvent();

        // Pass to your own custom function
        myCustomFunction(mpEvent);
    }
};

mediaSession.mediaEventListener(myCallback);
```
